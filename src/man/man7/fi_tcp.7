.SH NAME
.PP
fi_tcp \- The msg sockets Fabric Provider
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The tcp provider can be used on any system that supports TCP sockets.
The provider is not intended to provide performance improvements over
regular TCP sockets, but rather to allow developers to write, test,and
debug application code even on platforms that do not have
high\-performance fabric hardware.
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES
.PP
The following features are supported
.TP
.B \f[I]Endpoint types\f[]
\f[I]FI_EP_MSG\f[] is the only supported endpoint type.
Reliable datagram endpoint over TCP sockets can be achieved by layering
RxM over tcp provider.

.TP
.B \f[I]Endpoint capabilities\f[]
The tcp provider currently supports \f[I]FI_MSG\f[], \f[I]FI_RMA\f[]
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]Progress\f[]
Currently tcp provider supports only \f[I]FI_PROGRESS_MANUAL\f[]

.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
tcp provider is implemented over TCP sockets to emulate libfabric API.
Hence the performance is lower than what an application might see
implementing to sockets directly.
